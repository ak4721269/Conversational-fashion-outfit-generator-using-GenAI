# Conversation-fashion-outfit-generator-using-GenAI

We have created a  Conversational fashion outfit generator for Flipkart using GenAI.
This problem can be broken down into below sub problems.

#Data Collection
Initially,webscrapers  are created for fetching  Pinterest’s trending data.
Webscrapers created for fetching Instagram’s trending data for trending hashtags like #fashion , # influencers,etc.
Webcrawler created for logging into user’s flipkart account and fetch data of user’s order history.
Webscraping flipkart’s data for the section- clothing and accessories.
Classify the data collected into various labels related to fashion.


#AI Image Generation functionality

Finetuning the pretrained model of stable diffusion-  stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0 with the image dataset collected.
Finetuning has been done with SDXL 1.0  existing LORA weights for providing  more weights to social media trends, flipkart dataset and user history.
The finetuning of pretrained model will  for  user’s order history to give more weights to user’s choices dataset.
Create an AI image generator based on the new retrained model which is based on user’s prompt


##Product Recommendation Functionality

Compute the similarity of images between the image generated by AI image generator and the images for the corresponding search results on flipkart.
This similarity is calculated based on Euclidean distance between the images.
Recommend the top 5 products to the user based on the image similarity.


AI Image Editing and Recommendation functionality![image](https://github.com/ak4721269/Conversational-fashion-outfit-generator-using-GenAI/assets/37411935/c76e3910-0ef8-405d-b204-4a0e2d77e93f)

Add a editing functionality to the generated image if user wants to edit the image generated using prompt.
Pass the prompt and the generated image to the AI image editor created using the pretrained model of pix2pix cGAN model- timbrooks/instruct-pix2pix.
Recommend the top 5 products to the user based on the image similarity between the edited image and search results of flipkart image dataset.



#Future Scope


The  current stability diffusion model can be coupled with GAN for better image generation and feedback.

The user interface can be created on a dedicated server using Rest API and ReactJS framework.
Once the GAN model is used, text can be finetuned with the product names in user’s purchase history to provide more personalised product recommendation.
Currently, Euclidean distance is used for calculating image similarity.But, if more sophisticated infrastructure is provided,Deep Metric learning can be used to calculate image similarity to provide more accurate product recommendations
